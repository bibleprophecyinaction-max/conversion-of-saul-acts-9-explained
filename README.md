# Conversion of a Persecutor of Christ – Acts 9

Saul of Tarsus was a fierce persecutor of the early Church.

On his way to Damascus to arrest Christians, a bright light from heaven suddenly surrounded him.

He fell to the ground and heard a voice:
“Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?”

It was Jesus.

In that moment, Saul encountered the risen Christ and surrendered his life.

The persecutor became Paul the Apostle — a chosen vessel to preach the Gospel, turning many from darkness to light.

God transformed him completely.

The same risen Saviour can forgive sins and transform any life today.

If you trust in Jesus Christ, you too can receive forgiveness and eternal life.
